# Frontend Mentor - Sunnyside

![preview of order summary card](./desktop-preview.jpg)

This is a challenge from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/). Coded by [me](https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/Martin-K-Kamir)! üòÅ

Welcome to the repository for this project. Feel free to look around and expore! üòÄ

### Tools

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/)
- [AOS](https://github.com/michalsnik/aos#animations)

### Development

This is my first own react project and first frontend mentor solution. I had one course on react so I decided to practice my new skills. I mainly wanted to focus on JSX, so that is why i chose this simple solution from frontend mentor.

### Notes

The approach i choose for this landing page was go if it was big website. With this approach i made multiple scss files to stay very organized but i knew at the start it's not that necessary.

The biggest struggle i've had with this project was the design. Since the design sketch was set to 1440px width when i resized to 1920px the images were too big and i really did not like it. So i decided not to go pixel perfect and just go what looks good to me. It gave me more freedom with the layout, sizing etc.

Then i decided go little bit from the design and change couple of things and add couple cool features like sticking navbar, animation on scroll and carousel for testimonials.

Afterall with this project a think i improved my react skills bit more. I'm not very happy i did used react scroll animation library(AOS). I would be more pleased if i did my own JS code and make the scroll animations even better but i did not wanted waste more time on this.Anyway i did liked the AOS library. It's very easy to understand and use. For small project like this one i think it's good choice to use this.
